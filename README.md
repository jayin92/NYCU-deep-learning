# NYCU-deep-learning

This repository contains my coursework for the NYCU Deep Learning class.
Each folder corresponds to a lab assignment.

## Lab 1 – Backpropagation
A simple multilayer perceptron is implemented from scratch and trained on
linearly separable data and the XOR problem to demonstrate backpropagation.

## Lab 2 – Binary Semantic Segmentation
Implements UNet and a ResNet34‑UNet hybrid to segment the Oxford‑IIIT Pet dataset.

## Lab 3 – MaskGIT for Image Inpainting
A bi-directional Transformer trained with masked visual token modeling
restores missing regions of cat images using an iterative decoding process.

## Lab 4 – Conditional VAE for Video Prediction
A conditional variational autoencoder predicts the next video frame given
current pose information. Cyclical KL annealing improves PSNR performance.

## Lab 5 – Value-Based Reinforcement Learning
Enhanced Deep Q-Network techniques are applied to CartPole and Atari Pong,
integrating PER, DDQN, dueling architecture and more for sample efficiency.

## Lab 6 – Conditional Diffusion Model
A conditional DDPM generates images containing specified objects. Experiments
explore noise schedules, adaptive normalization and classifier guidance.

## Lab 7 – Policy-Based Reinforcement Learning
Advantage Actor-Critic and Proximal Policy Optimization solve Pendulum and
Walker2d tasks with Gaussian policies and GAE.
